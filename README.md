# Introduction
In this repository, you can find the source code of the website with general security guidelines for IoT systems’ security. The IoT systems that were tested during the minor are Smart Screens, Air Scrubber and Smartwatches.

Cyber Security Minor semester 2020-2021

You can view the site on [fontys-intersect.github.io](https://fontys-intersect.github.io)
# How to use
- The website consists of cases and guidelines that can be used to highlight and implement security features in IoT devices.
- The “Research” section consists of a Theory section that goes in-depth on the already existing best practises and OWASP Top 10 that we have used as requirements for the setup of the guidelines.
- It also has a section “Other Contenders” that houses the other sources that we used for information gathering.

# Reflection
In general, the final feedback from the stakeholders was positive, by including some small remarks. The stakeholders were satisfied with our results and the final website with security guidelines for IoT.

The main remark was to add the software version and date to the cases on our website. This will help to keep track of how old the information is and as soon as this project is planned for 8 years, the general security principles may change, together with the software versions.
# Improvements
Further improvements of this website is to expand it with more cases and best practices. If this will be done, the reliability of the guidelines increases. As time goes by, the best practices can be updated to improve the quality of the research and change based on the recent changes in general IoT devices.

# Introduction

## Objective

The objective of these guidelines is to show how to secure IoT devices better in the current best possible way.
This will done by doing research, performing pentest and analysis.

## Scope

The scope of this project is only an industrial system with the associated sensors and a Smartscreen.
If there is more time to perform pentests, we will
be looking at other environments to test. That possible environment is not only a device; It will be something that's running on an OS, has communication, connections and a back-end system.

## Target Audience

The guidelines presented are there for individuals or companies to use to secure their IoT devices better.
We have made sure to present our guidelines in a way that everyone can understand and implement them on their own.

## Structure of the website

The structure of the website is as followed: the [research](/research) for this project, including research questions, used methods etc. The [cases](/cases) we did
result in common vulnerabilities, those vulnerabilities could be used to create [best practices](/bestpractices/index). For each case we used the same approach which can be seen
[here](/pentestapproach).

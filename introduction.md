# Introduction

## Objective
The objective of these guidelines is to show how to secure IOT devices better in the current best possible way.
This will done by doing research, performing pentest and analysis.

## Scope
The scope of this project is only an industrial system with the associated sensors and an Smartscreen. 
If there is more time to perform pentests, we will
be looking at other environments to test. That possible environment is not only a device; It will be something that's running on an OS, has communication, connections and a back-end system.

## Target Audience
The guidelines presented are there for individuals or companies to use to secure their IOT devices better.
We have made sure to present our guidelines in a way that everyone can understand and implement them on their own.

## Structure of the website
The structure of the website is listed below:
- Each subsection of the project has it's own page (Research, Introduction, Threats etc.)
- For each aspect in the guidelines there will be an explanation page based on the [template](https://fontys-intersect.github.io/subject)

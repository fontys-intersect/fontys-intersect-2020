# Introduction

The digitization of our society and our economy has led to a dependency on information and communication technologies and thus to serious risks related to our cybersecurity. Until recently risks were, in general, restricted to information security, network security and application security ensuring the confidentiality, the availability and the integrity of data, but with the Internet-of-Things (IoT) we are seamlessly connecting the cyber and the physical worlds extending the risk area to safety requiring a broader perspective on security.

This is a problem that the INTERSCT project wants to shed a light and by doing this make it possible to increase the security of IoT devices.

## Objective

The objective of these guidelines is to show how to secure IoT devices better in the current best possible way.
This will be done by doing research performing pentest and analysis.

## Scope

The scope of this project is only an industrial system with the associated sensors and a Smartscreen.
If there is more time to perform pentests, we will
be looking at other environments to test. That possible environment is not only a device; It will be something that's running on an OS, has communication, connections and a back-end system.

## Target Audience

The guidelines presented are there for individuals or companies to use to secure their IoT devices better.
We have made sure to present our guidelines in a way that everyone can understand and implement on their own.

## Structure of the research

The research approach of this project is case-based. This means that all our information is backed by one or more case studies. During this project, three case studies have been done. More about the case studies can be found [here](/cases/). Besides the case studies, a literature study has been done. Combining these research approaches enhances the overall quality of these guidelines.

## Structure of the website

The structure of the website is as following: the [research](/research) for this project, including research questions, used methods, etc. The [cases](/cases) we did
result in common vulnerabilities, those vulnerabilities were used to create [best practices](/bestpractices/index).

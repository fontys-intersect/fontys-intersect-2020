This website describes the research conducted on behalf of the [INTERSCT](https://intersct.nl/) project.
The goal of this project was to write general guidelines for securing all IoT devices and applications.
We have researched more on a given smart office and smart industry case but we the guidelines are written more in general but based on the specific research we did.
INTERSCT is research for NWO about securing all IoT devices and applications so the goal of INTERSECT is to drive the change to a safe and secure IoT environment for the digital transformation in the Netherlands(INTERSECT, 2019).
Our part in this vision will be researching vulnerabilities in existing projects and writing guidelines based on our findings.

The Stakeholders for the project are [Ctouch](https://ctouch.eu/en), Fontys, INTERSCT. Specifically Teade Punter, Casper Schellekens and Mark Madsen.

In general, the client wants to have security guidelines of the most common flaws of IoT devices.
The client demands that the new documentation that will be used to secure their devices needs to be clear and easy to read.
This is, because it will be applied to real life situations.
The guidelines have to cover the most used IoT devices, because of their broad range of use and therefore their great potential for critical exploits.
It is expected that the most commonly found exploits will be covered and that section specific exploits will be named and/or highlighted for the users own research.

This website describes the research conducted on behalf of the INTERSCT project.
The goal of our project was to write general guidelines for securing all IoT devices and applications by pentesting multiple IoT devices.
The main focus was on smart office and smart industry cases but the guidelines are written more in general but based on the specific findings.
INTERSCT is research for NWO about securing all IoT devices and applications so the goal of INTERSECT is to drive the change to a safe and secure IoT environment for the digital transformation in the Netherlands(INTERSECT, 2019).
Our part in this vision will be researching vulnerabilities in existing projects and writing guidelines based on our findings.

The Stakeholders for the project are Ctouch, Fontys, INTERSCT. Specifically Teade Punter, Casper Schellekens and Mark Madsen.

In general, the stakeholder wanted to have security guidelines for the most common flaws of IoT devices.
The stakeholder demanded that the new documentation that will be used to secure their devices needs to be clear and easy to read.
This is because it will be applied to real-life situations.
The guidelines cover the most used IoT devices, because of their broad range of use and therefore their great potential for critical exploits.
It is expected that the most commonly found exploits are covered and that section-specific exploits will be named and/or highlighted for the user's research.

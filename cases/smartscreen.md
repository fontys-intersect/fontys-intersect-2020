## Subject Explanation
According to the [cyber kill chain](https://www.varonis.com/blog/cyber-kill-chain/) the screen and accorded services were tested. The tools that were used are mostly the same tools we use in Kali Linux for other pentests. Among these are:
- Burp Suite
- Nmap
- etc. %TODO%

During the pentest the [research](%TODO) was kept in mind according to known IoT vulnerabilities. 

## Strengths
The good aspects in the case/application

## Vulnerabilities
- ADB
- UPnP (if exploit worked)
- False firmware update

## Best practices


## Possible Fixes
Several possible solutions, their effectiveness, their implementation difficulties and maybe an example.

## Bibliography (APA)
- the document for the research of known vulnerabilities %TODO%

## Appendix 
Any extra pages about this subject.

# Cases
Since IoT is really broad, it can be divided into different categories. Those categories are as followed:
- Smart home
- Smart industry
- Smart office
- Smart health

The cases were all based on a different category, by this a clear view could be obtained. To create valid guidelines, 
results shouldn't be based on one category.
Each vulnerability in IoT systems have a best practice. In turn those vulnerabilities can be correlated to one of the following cases:
- [Airquality](/cases/airquality) (Smart industry)
- [Smartscreen](/cases/smartscreen) (Smart office)
- [Smartwatch](/cases/smartwatch) (Smart home)

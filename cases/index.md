# Cases

Since IoT is really broad, it can be divided into different categories. Those categories are as followed:

- Smart home
- Smart industry
- Smart office
- Smart health

The cases were all based on a different category so that a clear view could be obtained. To create valid guidelines, results shouldn't be based on one category. These are the cases that have been tested to get to the guidelines. All of the best practices are based on the findings in these cases:

- [Airquality](/cases/airquality) (Smart industry)
- [Smartscreen](/cases/smartscreen) (Smart office)
- [Smartwatch](/cases/smartwatch) (Smart home)

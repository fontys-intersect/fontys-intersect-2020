# Cases

Since IoT is really broad, it can be divided into different categories. Those categories are as followed:

- Smart home
- Smart industry
- Smart office
- Smart health

The cases were all based on a different category so that a clear view could be obtained. To create valid guidelines, results shouldn't be based on one category. These are the cases that have been tested to get to the guidelines. All of the best practices are based on the findings in these cases:

- [Airquality](/cases/airquality) (Smart industry)
- [Smartscreen](/cases/smartscreen) (Smart office)
- [Smartwatch](/cases/smartwatch) (Smart home)

## Pentest

Our main research was based on pentests of real IoT devices. For the sake of privacy and security, we cannot publish the tested devices, but we can explain their type. These devices were tested:

- Smartboard
        - This is a smartboard running android, mainly used in schools and board rooms. This product is also used in practice. The smartboard can both run its programs and be connected to a laptop or pc.

- Industrial air quality control system
        - This project has a backend server, a web interface, and several connected sensors. These sensors measure several air properties, the backend processes this date and the frontend shows graphs of the measurements. this way the clients can keep an eye on the air quality.

- Smartwatch(es)
        - This device has a frontend, backend and some built-in sensors. Smartwatches are mostly used to monitor health, save time and money.

## Explanation 
All the secrets including the public keys used for encryption should be stored in a secured place. If those secrets and keys are exposed to the public and aren't properly hidden, it will be easy task for the hackers to break the encryption and the security mechanisms.

## Uses
Like with passwords, secrets should be kept safe. They should be encrypted and stored in a secure place. They shouldn't be hard-coded into the software.

## Flaws
Even if the secrets are stored in a safe place, it's important that they're still accessible somehow. It should be made sure that the connection and data transfer between the storage and the program is also encrypted, or the secret will still come out.

## Cases
The cases that are relevant to this best practice

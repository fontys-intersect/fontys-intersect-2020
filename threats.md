# Threats

## Common vulnerabilities

| Threats        | Description          | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Weak, Guessable, or Hard Coded Passwords      | Use of easily brute forced, publicly available, or unchanged credentials, including backdoors in firmware or client software that grants unauthorized access to deployed systems. | 
| Insecure Network Services      | Unneeded or insecure network services running on the device itself, especially those exposed to the internet, that compromise the confidentiality, integrity/authenticity, or availability of information or allow unauthorized remote control.     | 
| Insecure Ecosystem Interfaces | Insecure web, backend API, cloud, or mobile interfaces in the ecosystem outside of the device that allows compromise of the device or its related components. Common issues include a lack of authentication/authorization, lacking or weak encryption, and a lack of input and output filtering.      |
| Lack of Secure Update Mechanism | Lack of ability to securely update the device. This includes lack of firmware validation on devices, lack of secure delivery (un-encrypted in transit), lack of anti-rollback mechanisms, and lack of notifications of security changes due to updates.      | 
| Use of Insecure or Outdated Components | Use of deprecated or insecure software components/libraries that could allow the device to be compromised. This includes insecure customization of operating system platforms, and the use of third-party software or hardware components from a compromised supply chain.      | 
| Insufficient Privacy Protection | Userâ€™s personal information stored on the device or in the ecosystem that is used insecurely, improperly, or without permission.       | 
| Insecure Data Transfer and Storage | Lack of encryption or access control of sensitive data anywhere within the ecosystem.      | 
| Lack of Device Management | Lack of security support on devices deployed in production.      | 
| Insecure Default Settings | Devices or systems shipped with insecure default settings or lack the ability to make the system more secure by restricting operators from modifying configurations.     | 
| Lack of Physical Hardening | Lack of physical hardening measures, allowing potential attackers to gain sensitive information that can help in a future remote attack or take local control of the device.     |

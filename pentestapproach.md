# General Pentest Approach and Tools
 

## First Target - AirScrubber project
 
Our first target was a device that is using different industrial IoT devices and web application interface. The purpose of the device is to suck in air, use the output from the IoT devices, that id used for measuring and analysing the different chemical compouts within the air, and finally filters it and "cleans" it.
The pentest strategy used was white box penetration test. We had a full access to the code and the implementations of the website, which was the target of our pentest. 
The technologies and languages used in the website were: React (Frontend), Java (Backend), Apache Kafka (Event Streaming Platform) and Docker environment. 

### Tools used
- nmap
- BurpSuite

## Second target - Smart screens

The nature of this pentest was a blackbox penetration test.
 The devices were smart screens that are connected to the internet. They were using Android as an operating system and we had a physical access to them, but without having access to the firmware.

### Tools used
- nmap
- CallStranger
- BurpSuite
- Android SDK
- Python

## Third target - Smart watches

The third target that we agreed to test were different smartwatches. This was also a blackbox penetration test. We tested three different smartwatches, all with different operating system and created by different manifacturers.


### Tools used
- nmap
- Ettercap
- Tizen Studio

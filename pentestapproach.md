# General Pentest Approach and Tools

## First Target - Airquality project

Our first target was a device that is using different industrial IoT devices and a web application interface. The purpose of the device is to suck in air, use the output from the IoT devices, that id used for measuring and analyzing the different chemical compounds within the air, and finally filters it and "cleans" it.
The pentest strategy used was a whitebox penetration test. We had full access to the code and the implementations of the website, which was the target of our pentest.
The technologies and languages used in the website were: React (Frontend), Java (Backend), Apache Kafka (Message broker) and Docker environment.

### Tools used

- Nmap
- BurpSuite

## Second target - Smartscreen

The nature of this pentest was a blackbox penetration test.
 The devices were smart screens that are connected to the internet. They were using Android as an operating system and we had physical access to them, but no access to the firmware source code.

### Tools used

- Nmap
- CallStranger
- BurpSuite
- Android SDK
- Python

## Third target - Smartwatch

The third target that we agreed to test was different smartwatches. This was also a blackbox penetration test. We tested three different smartwatches, all with a different operating system and created by different manufacturers.

### Tools used

- nmap
- Ettercap
- Tizen Studio

# General Pentest Approach and Tools
 

## First Target - AirScrubber project
 
Our first target was project, which was a device that is using different industrial IoT devices and web application interface. The purpose of the device is to suck in air, use the output from the IoT devices, that id used for measuring and analysing the different chemical compouts within the air, and finally filters it and "cleans" it.
The pentest strategy used was white box penetration test. We had a full access to the code and the implementations of the website, which was the target of our pentest. 
The technologies and languages used in the website were: React (Frontend), Java (Backend), Kafka (Web Server) and Docker envirnment. 

### Tools used
- nmap
- BurpSuite

## Second target - Smart screens

The nature of this pentest was a blackbox penetration test.
It was agreed with our clients to search for vulnerabilities and try to exploit them. The devices itself were interactive touch smart screens that are connected to the internet. They were using Android as an operating system and we had a physical access to them.

### Tools used
- nmap
- CallStranger
- BurpSuite
- Android SDK
- Python

## Third target - Smart watches

The third target that we agreed to test were different smartwatches. This was also a blackbox penetration test. The availability of smartwatches was limited which narrowed down the scope to only the available devices.


### Tools used
- nmap
- Ettercap
- Tizen Studio

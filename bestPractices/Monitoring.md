## Explanation 
A lot of things happen within your application or website. Knowing what is going on and where is very important. Monitoring your application and logging what happens will help to alert when something is wrong. You can use several different applications or frameworks to monitor or log, but the output is the same; it'll tell you if there are too many login attempts, for example. You can use different tactics to stop this.

## Uses
When you monitor your application, you will know what is happening and how users are using your application. If you can see someone attempting to hack into your website, the monitoring system will issue a warning and other systems will try and stop it. You will also know what damage will have been done and how to reverse the damage.

## Flaws
It's important to finetune the monitoring system; overreporting can be just as dangerous as underreporting. If you see every single click someone is making, you won't be able to tell when something is coming from a hacker through the slew of warnings and mentions you'll be getting. There might also be false positives and false negatives.

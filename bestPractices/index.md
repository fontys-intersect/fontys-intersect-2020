# Best practises
A best practice is a method or technique that has been generally accepted as superior to any alternatives because it produces results that are superior to those achieved by other means or because it has become a standard way of doing things,
e.g., a standard way of complying with legal or ethical requirements.

## Why
Incorporating what has proven to work somewhere else forms the basis of any high-quality project.

## Ingredients
- A willingness to investigate what others have done.
- A sense of scope: which reported practices are important to you, and which are not?
- A critical sense of success factors.
- The ability to overcome the ‘not invented here’ syndrome.

## Cases
The best practices are based on the cases. Every best practice is referred to at least one of those cases.
Some IoT systems have best or bad practices in common, those can be seen [here](https://fontys-intersect.github.io/commonIoTFlaws).

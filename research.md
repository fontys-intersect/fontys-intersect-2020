## Theory

Before we started this project we looked into the existing guidelines written by other people and organizations. This gave us a pretty clear insight into the requirements of a good general guideline. These three are the best guidelines we could find:

- [OWASP IoT Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP-IoT-Top-10-2018-final.pdf)
- [Enisa IoT good practices](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/iot/good-practices-for-iot-and-smart-infrastructures-tool)
- [Guidelines for Overcoming some IoT Security Issues](https://www.iim.ftn.uns.ac.rs/is17/papers/33.pdf)

These three formed the base for our research into IoT devices and their guidelines. //TODO Problems with these guidelines?

## Pentest

Our main research was based on pentests of real IoT devices. For the sake of privacy and security, we cannot publish the tested devices, but we can explain their type. These devices were tested:

- Smart board
        - This is a smart board running android, mainly used in schools and board rooms. This product is also used in practice.

- Industrial air filter
        - This device is has a backend server, a frontend webinterface and some connected sensors.

- Smart watch(es)
        - This device has a frontend, backend and some built-in sensors.
